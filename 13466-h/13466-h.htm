    <h2>THE PRINCE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Letter from Nicola Puncio Machiavelli to the Most
    Illustrious Vittorio Emanuele, Son of Umberto, King of
    Italy.</i>)</h4>

    <h4>I.</h4>

    <p>There never was, nor is at this day, any man in the world
    who is not either a Prince or not a Prince. Seeing, therefore,
    that your Highness appertains of right to the class of them
    that are Princes, and being ambitious to present to your
    Highness that which should have the chiefest value in your
    eyes, I could not (though pondering much) deem anything more
    precious than the knowledge of men and of governments which I
    have learned through a space of half a hundred years. Forasmuch
    as your Highness hath travelled over stormy seas to the island
    of the British folk, I do presume to present to your Highness,
    as being one that seeketh wisdom, the ripe fruit of my
    knowledge, in order that your Highness may suck thereout such
    advantage as those who love your land chiefly desire both for
    yourself and for them to whose government you shall in the
    future be called.</p>

    <h4>II.&mdash;<i>How a Prince is to gain Reputation.</i></h4>

    <p>To begin, then, I say it would be advantageous to be
    accounted both liberal and of a like nature unto other men that
    are not Princes. For although the majority of mankind be
    penurious and apt to hoard their money, and although in their
    assembly the British make a show of niggardliness, imputing it
    to themselves for a virtue, nevertheless, if they discern in a
    Prince such inclinations as they praise in themselves, no
    nation was ever quicker to blame or decry. For each holds in
    private that while he himself is generous, the rest are mean
    and covetous. Therefore, I counsel you let your conduct in the
    bestowal both of snuff-boxes, which no man at this day uses,
    and of scarf-pins, which are a delight to many, be so ordered
    that men may think of you as one that with a true generosity
    performs such acts as each of them, were he a Prince, would
    perform as well.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/49.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/49.png"
             alt="Nicola Puncio Machiavelli and Prince Vittorio Emanuele." />
        </a>
    </div>

    <p>Likewise if there be those who wish to read unto you
    addresses of loyal welcome, it is not well to flout them
    publicly by showing signs of sleep; since it is the fashion of
    municipalities and Mayors to hold themselves to be of high
    importance, and a wise flattery of this self-deception well
    becomes you. And in replying, let your speech be both short and
    homely. The present German Emperor came lately among this
    people, and, having spoken aloud of the kindness of his
    Grandmamma, at once the hearts of all of them that are or hope
    to be grandmammas, or have themselves possessed a grandmamma,
    were moved to him so that he was accounted one of themselves
    from that time forth.</p>

    <p>Again, how honourable it is for a Prince to be outspoken,
    candid, and truthful, I suppose everybody understands.
    Nevertheless, experience has shown in our times that those
    Princes who have not pinned themselves up to that excess of
    truth-speaking, have not alone secured the love of their
    subjects, but have been held up as patterns of a royal wisdom
    and virtue. For in the assemblages of the great that shall be
    gathered in your honour, and in the banquets and receptions
    wherewith it is customary to overwhelm a Prince, there must
    often be those surrounding him, and holding converse with him,
    whose absence would cause him joy rather than sorrow, on
    account of their exceeding pompous dulness. Yet it is well at
    such times for a Prince to conceal his feelings, and, though he
    be flattened with tedious ceremony, to keep both a cheerful
    countenance and a pleasant tongue, as of one to whom life
    offers a succession of the proudest and happiest moments. There
    is a Prince at this time in being (but his name I shall
    conceal), who can often have nothing in his mind but sorrow and
    depression, so many are his labours and so great is the number
    of the foundation-stones he lays; and yet, had he revealed
    either the one or the other by speech or gesture, they had
    robbed him before this of his power and reputation.</p>

    <h4>III.&mdash;<i>Of the Wearing of Uniforms.</i></h4>

    <p>A Prince should have many uniforms, and wear them with much
    show and glitter. For it is expected of Princes that before
    they be weaned they should be Colonels, and should rank as
    Field-Marshals at a time when other lads still trail themselves
    to school. It is not indeed related of CÆSAR that he drilled a
    regiment at the age of six, nor of HANNIBAL that being yet a
    boy he did aught but take an oath. Yet now the custom of the
    world is otherwise, and a Prince who should never shine in the
    array of a soldier might justly be held odious and
    contemptible. That very German Emperor of whom I have spoken,
    won the applause of the multitude by cuirass and helmet, and
    having donned a British Admiral's uniform, was held of great
    account amongst a people apt for the rule of the sea. This
    honour in truth falls not to all; but others, and yourself
    among the number, may be made Post Captains, and wear a naval
    dress both with comfort and approbation.</p>

    <h4>IV.&mdash;<i>Of Italy.</i></h4>

    <p>Here in the land to which you have come you shall find all
    men lovers of Italy. For there is not one of those that watched
    her long and grievous struggles, that did not welcome with a
    heartfelt joy her deliverance, both from foreign yoke and from
    native tyrants. Here too they know that the example of your
    illustrious family, the wisdom and moderation of your father
    not less than the unquenchable valour and bodily strength of
    your grandfather, his contempt of danger, his devotion to duty,
    shone forth as a star before the eyes of all Italians, even in
    their darkest hours. Who is there that hath not the liveliest
    hope that all prosperity may be confirmed to that beloved
    country, that she may advance from greatness to greatness, that
    her kings may be just, her people free and contented. Let your
    illustrious family, then, still address itself to the work with
    courage and confidence, that under them Italy may stand forth
    an example to the nations of the world.</p>

    <p>I fancy it must be by Lord TENNYSON, but I cannot find it
    either in <i>In Memoriam</i> or the <i>Idylls of the King</i>.
    The line has been much admired by competent critics. A
    beautiful little volume of verse, recently published, is <i>The
    Fall of Cetewayo</i>. Possibly the line may be in that
    book.&mdash;P.S.&mdash;Is not £76 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> too
    high a price to charge for bringing out an Epic Poem of 8000
    lines, even if, as is asserted, there have been "no
    sales"?&mdash;LAUREATE PRESUMPTIVE.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>MEREDITHOMANIA.&mdash;Miss HANNAH LYNCH (Author of <i>George
    Meredith&mdash;a Study</i>) is almost incoherently angry with
    "the inexcusable and comical consistency of stupidity"
    manifested by all those who are not, in the fullest sense,
    "Meredith-men"&mdash;or women. She is, however, so dogmatic and
    disdainful, that one suspects her of a tendency to substitute
    for the judicial verdict of the critical judgment-seat, the
    arbitrary and excessive punishment of "Lynch-law!"</p>

    <p><i>Russian Bigwig</i> (<i>reading letter</i>). "And they are
    to be received with the greatest possible enthusiasm!" I can
    scarcely believe my eyes! The Fleet of the French Republic!</p>

    <p><i>Subordinate</i> (<i>using a Muscovite imprecation</i>).
    <i>Caviare droski!</i></p>

    <p><i>Rus. Big.</i> (<i>severely</i>). Slave! (Sub.
    <i>cringes</i>.) Another word, and I will have you knouted to
    death! It is the wish of our Little Father, the Czar of the
    Universe.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>They both fall on their knees, remove their hats,
        and sing the National Hymn.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Sub.</i> (<i>bowing to the ground</i>). And what are the
    Imperial wishes?</p>

    <p><i>Rus. Big.</i> That not only shall the
    "<i>Marseillaise</i>" be tolerated when played by the French,
    but also be performed by our own bands. (<i>With a burst of
    rage.</i>) Oh, <i>Caviare droski!</i></p>

    <p><i>Sub.</i> (<i>on his knees</i>). I would also add an oath,
    O Supreme Protector-of-the-Spirit-of-my-dead-Grandmother, had
    you not forbidden that extreme expression of opinion.</p>

    <p><i>Rus. Big.</i> You recall me to myself. O
    Son-of-PETER-son-of-PETER-son-of-PETER-son-of-TOMMY. I was
    wrong. But it makes my blood boil to think that our Master and
    his ancestors who scorned LOUIS PHILIPPE and NAPOLEON III.
    should recognise a Republic!</p>

    <p><i>Sub.</i> (<i>aside</i>). Say you so&mdash;this to the
    CZAR&mdash;thou Nihilist! (<i>Aloud.</i>) My
    Lord-the-comforter-of-the-spirit-of-my-first-cousin-once-removed-on-my-mother's-side,
    is indeed right! It is a painful sight!</p>

    <p><i>Rus. Big.</i> (<i>aside</i>). Say you so&mdash;this to
    the CZAR&mdash;thou Nihilist! (<i>Aloud.</i>) But perhaps we
    might improve matters. Supposing that the "<i>Marseillaise</i>"
    were imperfectly performed?</p>

    <p><i>Sub.</i> (<i>with note-book</i>). Excellent, my Lord!
    excellent! It shall be played out of tune on a score of
    regimental bands! Good, my Lord! good!</p>

    <p><i>Rus. Big.</i> And could not a translation be furnished
    suggesting ideas foreign to the original?</p>

    <p><i>Sub.</i> Again capital, my Lord. I will see that the
    troops have a version that gives the old legend (stolen from us
    by the English) of "The Song of Sixpence, or a pocketful of
    Rye-bread," as the real translation.</p>

    <p><i>Rus. Big.</i> A happy thought! The moral is wholesome.
    The Monarchical principle is advocated in the approved counting
    out of money and consumption of bread and honey by their
    Majesties, and the right of life and death is suggested by the
    pecking off of the nose of the housemaid while employed in
    hanging out the clothes! And about the troops&mdash;have they
    been warned that they might some day be expected to give a
    hated alien an enthusiastic reception?</p>

    <p><i>Sub.</i> They have, my Lord. And in anticipation of such
    an occasion, they have been taught for the last six months how
    to cheer in a whisper.</p>

    <p><i>Rus. Big.</i> Good! And now to a pleasanter duty. Have
    you those hundred <span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"
       id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span> thousand copies of
       <i>Punch</i> that were yesterday seized at the frontier?</p>

    <p><i>Sub.</i> I have, my Lord!</p>

    <p><i>Rus. Big.</i> (<i>with fiendish glee</i>). To Siberia
    with them! Come, help me to post them!</p>

    <p><i>Sub.</i> (<i>trembling</i>). But, my Lord, should
    <i>Punch</i> be read by the political prisoners who lie covered
    with chains in the secret mines under the lowest mountain in
    the Czar's dominions? What then?</p>

    <p><i>Rus. Big.</i> (<i>in an awesome whisper</i>). Mark me
    well! In the present pitiable state of the prisoners, such a
    feast of mirth-compelling waggery would kill them&mdash;yes,
    <i>kill</i> them&mdash;with laughter!</p>

    <h2>TWO VIEWS OF THE NEXT INVASION.</h2>

    <h3>THE OPTIMIST.</h3>

    <p>The British Fleet, by a sad mischance, had disappeared.</p>

    <p>It was then that the Nation had to depend upon its second
    line of defence&mdash;the Army.</p>

    <p>The enemy flushed with victory, attempted to land, but were
    met with such a withering fire from the Volunteer Artillery,
    that they had to abandon the attempt in despair&mdash;at least
    for awhile. They retired for the night, and on the following
    morning were in front of Westgate-on-Sea. It was then found how
    wise the Committee of Home Defence had been in their
    recommendation. Feeling sure that the forces of the Crown would
    be ample to beat back any hostile attempt to seize a town the
    centre of one of the best of charities (St. Michael's
    Convalescent Home), the Committee had deprecated the suggestion
    of erecting extensive fortifications. Practically Westgate was
    without walls. But there was a better defence than brickwork.
    The Authorities had not been idle during the night, having
    utilised the Pause in the war to bring up two magnificent
    battalions of Militia&mdash;the 7th Rifle Brigade and the 4th
    Cheshire Regiment. Thus when the enemy succeeded in effecting a
    landing, they found themselves confronted by the very flower of
    the British Army. In ten minutes the hostile host were crumpled
    up like a sheet of paper, and disappeared in hot retreat.</p>

    <p>During the following week the entire army of the foe was
    allowed to land in England, and were speedily exterminated. The
    contract given out by Government to an advertising undertaker
    was the means of making that contractor's fortune. Within ten
    days England was absolutely free from invasion.</p>

    <p>"And are you surprised?" asked a journalist, addressing the
    greatest tactician of the century.</p>

    <p>"Surprised!" echoed the other. "Why it was what we all
    expected from the first!"</p>

    <h3>THE PESSIMIST.</h3>

    <p>The British Fleet, by a carefully calculated plan, had
    disappeared. It was then that the Nation had to depend upon its
    second line of defence&mdash;the Army.</p>

    <p>The enemy, although somewhat depressed at the losses they
    had sustained, attempted to land, and of course were
    successful. The picked batteries from Woolwich, consisting of
    the Royal Horse Artillery, opened fire, but without the
    smallest effect. On the following morning the main force of the
    enemy appeared in front of Margate, the recently fortified
    port. It was then found how foolish the Committee of Home
    Defence had been in their recommendation. Feeling doubtful of
    the means the Government would have at their command to defend
    an unprotected town, they had ordered every village on the
    coast to be surrounded by the most intricate network of bricks
    and earthworks. And now, in the hour of need, these elaborate
    preparations were valueless. The troops of the enemy poured
    into Margate almost without opposition. The forts were silenced
    in five minutes, and although on the following morning the
    Household Brigade came to the rescue, the assistance thus
    afforded was of no avail.</p>

    <p>During the succeeding week the entire army of the foe was
    allowed to land in England, and were immediately victorious.
    The contract for finding them lodgings in London made
    somebody's fortune. Within a week England was grovelling in the
    dust at the feet of her conquerors.</p>

    <p>"And are you surprised?" asked a journalist, addressing the
    greatest tactician of the century.</p>

    <p>"Surprised!" he echoed&mdash;"why it was what we all
    expected from the first!"</p>

        covered terrace, with coffee.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Podbury</i> (<i>producing a pipe</i>). Not such a bad
    dinner! Expect they'll rook us a lot for it, though. Rather
    fun, seeing the waiters all troop in with a fresh course, when
    the proprietor rang his bell. Like a ballet at the
    Empire&mdash;eh?</p>

    <p><i>Culchard</i> (<i>selecting a cigarette</i>). I'm not in a
    position to say. I don't affect those places of entertainment
    myself.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Oh! Where <i>do</i> you turn in when you want
    to kick up your heels a bit? Madame Tussaud's? I say, why on
    earth didn't you talk to that old bloke next to you at dinner?
    He was trying all he knew to be friendly.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Was he? I daresay. But I rather understood we
    came out with the idea of keeping out of all that.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Of course. <i>I'm</i> not keen about getting to
    know people. He had no end of a pretty daughter, though. Mean
    to say you didn't spot her?</p>

    </div>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> If by "spotting" you mean&mdash;was I aware of
    the existence of a very exuberant young person, with a most
    distressing American accent? I can only say; that she made her
    presence sufficiently evident. I confess she did not interest
    me to the point of speculating upon her relationship to anybody
    else.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Well&mdash;if you come to that, I don't know
    that I&mdash;still, she was uncommonly&mdash;(<i>Happens to
    glance round, and lowers his voice.</i>) Jove! she's in the
    Reading-room, just behind us. (<i>Hums, with elaborate
    carelessness.</i>) La di
    deedle-lumpty&mdash;loodle-oodle-loo&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>who detests humming</i>). By the way, I
    wish you hadn't been in such a hurry to come straight on. I
    particularly wanted to stop at Bruges, and see the
    Memlings.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> I do like that! For a fellow who wants to keep
    out of people's way! They'd have wanted you to stay to lunch
    and dinner, most likely.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>raising his eyebrows</i>). Hardly, my dear
    fellow&mdash;they're pictures, as it happens.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>unabashed</i>). Oh, are they? Any way,
    you've fetched up your average here. Weren't there enough in
    the Museum for you?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>pityingly</i>). You surely wouldn't call
    the collection here exactly representative of the best period
    of Flemish Art?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> If you ask me, I should call it a simply
    footling show&mdash;but you were long enough over it. (CULCHARD
    <i>shudders slightly, and presently pats his pockets</i>.)
    What's up now? Nothing gone wrong with the works, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>with dignity</i>). No&mdash;I was merely
    feeling for my note-book. I had a sudden idea for a sonnet,
    that's all.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Ah, you shouldn't have touched those mussels
    they gave us with the sole. Have a nip of this cognac, and
    you'll soon be all right.</p>

    <blockquote>

        de Lecture, and seat themselves at an adjoining
        table</i>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Miss Trotter</i>. Well, I guess it's gayer out here,
    anyway. That Reading Saloon is just about as lively as a
    burying lot with all the tombs unlet. I want the address of
    that man who said that Brussels was a second Parrus.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Trotter</i>. Maybe we ain't been long enough off the
    cars to jedge yet. Do you feel like putting on your hat and
    sack, and sorter smellin' round this capital?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Not any. I expect the old city will have to
    curb its impatience to see me till to-morrow. I'm tired
    some.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). Confound it, how can
    I&mdash;! (<i>Looks up, and observes</i> Miss T. <i>with a
    sudden attention</i>). That fellow PODBURY has better taste
    than I gave him credit for. She <i>is</i> pretty&mdash;in her
    peculiar style&mdash;<i>quite</i> pretty! Pity she speaks with
    that deplorable accent.</p>

    cut off again? Come for a toddle. You don't mean to stick here
    all the evening, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Well, we might take a turn later on, and see
    the effect of St. Gudule in the moonlight.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Something <i>like</i> a rollick that! But what
    do you say to dropping in quietly at the Eden for an hour or
    so, eh? Variety show and all that going on.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Thanks&mdash;variety shows are not much in my
    line; but don't mind me if you want to go.</p>

    did. I wish he'd come along right here.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> I presume he's put in all the time he had for
    Belgium&mdash;likely we'll fetch up against him somewhere
    before he's through.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, and I don't care how soon we do,
    either. CHARLEY's a bright man, and real cultivated. I'm always
    telling him that he's purrfectly splendid company, considering
    he's only a cousin.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> That's so every time. I like CHARLEY VAN
    BOODELER first-rate myself.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). If CHARLEY VAN BOODELER
    was <i>engaged</i> to her, I suppose he'd be here. Pshaw! What
    <i>does</i> it matter? Somehow, I rather wish now that
    I'd&mdash;but perhaps we shall get into conversation presently.
    Hang it, here's that fellow PODBURY back again! Wish to
    goodness he'd&mdash; (<i>To</i> PODBURY.) Hallo, so you haven't
    started yet?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Been having a talk with the porter. He says
    there's a big fair over by the Station du Midi, and it's worth
    seeing. Are you game to come along and sample it, eh?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>with an easy indifference intended for</i>
    Miss T.'s <i>benefit</i>). No, I think not, thanks. I'm very

    remark that there was a festivity in progress in this city?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> So I'm told; a fair, down in the new part. I
    could tell you how to get to it, if you thought of going.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> Well, I don't see how I should ever strike
    that fair for myself, and I guess if there's anything to be
    seen we're bound to <i>see</i> it, so me and my
    darter&mdash;allow me to introduce my darter to you&mdash;MAUD,
    this gentleman is Mr.&mdash;I don't think I've caught your
    name, Sir&mdash;PODBURY?&mdash;Mr. PODBURY who's kindly
    volunteered to conduct us round.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>eagerly</i>). But won't you come? Do. I
    shall be awfully glad if you will!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> If it makes you so glad as all that, I
    believe I'll come. Though what you could say different, after
    Father had put it up so steep on you, <i>I</i> don't know. I'll
    just go and fix myself first.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. T.</i> (<i>to</i> PODBURY). My only darter, Sir, and
    a real good girl. We come over from the States, crossed a month
    ago to-day, and seen a heap already. Been runnin' all over
    Scotland and England, and kind of looked round Ireland and
    Wales, and now what <i>we've</i> got to do is to see as much as
    we can of Germany and Switzerland and It'ly, and get some idea
    of France before we start home this fall. I guess we're both of
    us gettin' pretty considerable homesick already. My darter was

       along without maple syrup <i>much</i> longer. (Miss TROTTER

    <h2>THE WRONG OF SEARCH.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Dream of the British Inquisition.</i>)</h4>

    <p>The unfortunate foreigner, travel-stained and suffering from
    the after-glow of a stormy passage, crawled up the gangway and
    was once more on land. He carried in his hand a
    portmanteau.</p>

    <p>"Have you anything to declare?" asked an official, in a
    gold-peaked cap and blue frock coat, gruffly.</p>

    <p>"Only that your seas are terrible," was the reply.</p>

    <p>The official made no answer, but merely pointed to some
    planks that had been placed upon trestles. The foreigner
    glanced at the people who were standing in front of these
    planks, and noticed that they were pale with apprehension.</p>

    <p>"Have you anything to declare?" was a second time
    uttered&mdash;now by a person less gold-laced. Then the
    official continued, "Here, open it!"</p>

    <p>In a moment the portmanteau was thrown with force on the
    planks, and the foreigner protested.</p>

    <p>"I understand you now. I have no cigars&mdash;I do not
    smoke. I have no spirits&mdash;I am what you call a
    teatotaller. I have no lace&mdash;I am a widower."</p>

    <p>"Open it!" was once more the cry&mdash;this time with great
    vehemence.</p>

    <p>"But I am innocent of concealing anything! Believe me, there
    is nothing to declare! I have some photographic plates&mdash;to
    open them is ruin! I prize my shirts&mdash;they are
    heirlooms&mdash;if they are roughly handled I can never wear
    them again." And the foreigner wrung his hands in his
    despair.</p>

    <p>"If you will not open it," replied the official, unmoved by
    his eloquent appeal, "we shall detain your luggage."</p>

    <p>"But this is barbarous&mdash;cruel," continued the
    foreigner, answering with excitement. "I have been to
    Constantinople with its mosques, and the Turks have treated me
    with greater consideration. I have seen the glories of Rome
    with its Forum, the splendours of Petersburg with its fortress
    prison, the treasures of Madrid with its art gallery&mdash;and
    everywhere&mdash;everywhere I have been treated with greater
    kindness, greater charity than here! And yet you say this is
    the land of the brave and the free!"</p>

    <p>"We say nothing of the sort," retorted the official; "we
    say, open it!"</p>

    <p>The foreigner, whose pallor was fearful to see, with his
    teeth clenched and his eyes starting from his head, put the key
    into the portmanteau lock, turned it, and the contents of the
    box was revealed to view.</p>

    <p>In a moment the officials were upon it&mdash;thrusting their
    inquisitive hands here, there, and everywhere. There was a
    salad of boots, waistcoats, collars and brushes. At length they
    came to the photographic plates&mdash;they were removed in a
    trice from their receptacle, and held up to the light.</p>

    <p>"Have you no hearts!" cried the foreigner, his face
    streaming with tears. "In a moment you have undone the labour
    of years! That plate&mdash;now destroyed for ever&mdash;when
    properly developed would have revealed the smiling features of
    my wife's mother! It took me a quarter of a century to catch
    her with such an expression! For when she saw me she always
    frowned. But ah, my shirts, my heirlooms! In the name of mercy,
    spare my shirts!"</p>

    <p>But no, once more the appeal was disregarded. The small
    portmanteau was turned inside out. This the official

    <p>"So this is one of the habits of the English," cried the

    <p>"Not only the habits, Monsieur," observed a bystander, who
    trembling with apprehension, was waiting his turn; "but the
    customs. Customs that are out of date with the age. Customs
    that are contrary to the spirit of the century. Customs that
    cost more than they yield, and deserve to be cussed!"</p>

    <p>"They do," cried the foreigner, excitedly. "May the Customs
    be&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"You must not utter that word," interrupted the Revenue
    Officer, in a tone of peremptory command.</p>

    <p>"It is British; why not?"</p>

    <p>But although the foreigner was baffled in his desire to use
    the appropriate imprecation&mdash;he thought it!</p>

    <h2>ON THE BRIDGE!</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Much Modernised Version of "The Vision of
    Mirzah."</i>)</h4>

    <p>On the second day of the week, commonly called Saint Monday
    (which according to the Customs of my Forefathers, I always
    keep as Holiday), after having washed myself, and offered up my
    Morning Devotions at the shrine of Nicotine, I turned over the
    pages of <i>Bradshaw</i>, with a view to passing the rest of
    the day in some more or less Rural Retirement.</p>

    <p>As I was here confusing myself with the multitudinous
    Complexities of this recondite Tome, I fell into a profound
    Contemplation of the Vanity of human Holiday-making; and,
    passing from one puzzling page to another, Surely, said I, Man
    is but a Muddler and Life a Maze!</p>

    <p>"Right you are!" sounded a mysterious voice in my ear.</p>

    <p>The Sound of the voice was exceeding Sweet, and wrought into
    a variety of inflections. It put me in mind of those heavenly
    Airs that are played from the tops of closely-packed wheeled
    Vehicles, from many-keyed Concertinas upon Bank-Holidays. My
    Heart melted away in Secret Raptures. By which signs
    I&mdash;who had read my <i>Spectator</i> at the Free
    Library&mdash;knew well that I was in the company of a Genius!
    It is only Genii who drop upon one suddenly and unannounced,
    with a more or less pertinent commentary upon one's Inner
    Thoughts, in this fashion. I felt at once that I was in for the
    true Addisonian Oriental Apologue in all its hybrid
    incongruity.</p>

    <p>I drew near with that Reverence which is due to a
    Superior&mdash;if nondescript Nature; and as my Heart was
    entirely subdued by the captivating Voice I had heard, I fell
    down at his Feet and wept. I could hardly have explained why,
    but 'tis the sort of thing one always does in an Eastern
    Apologue. The Genius smiled upon me with a Look of Compassion
    and Affability that familiarised him to my Imagination, at once
    dispelled all the Fears and Apprehensions with which I
    approached him, and turned off my Tearfulness "at the main," as
    <i>Samuel Weller</i> said, concerning the Mulberry One. He
    lifted me from the ground, and, taking me by the hand,
    "MIRZAH," said he, "I have heard thee in thy Soliloquies;
    follow me!"</p>

    <p>Now, my name is <i>not</i> MIRZAH, but MATTHEW. Yet, after
    all, it did not much matter, and I felt it would be in
    questionable taste to correct a Genius.</p>

    <p>He then led me to the highest Pinnacle of a Rock, and,
    placing me on the Top of it, "Cast thy Eyes yonder," said he,
    "and tell me what thou seest." "I see," said I, "a huge Valley,
    and a prodigious Roadway running through it." "The Valley that
    thou seest," said he, "is the Vale of Travel, and the Roadway
    that thou beholdest is part of the great Railway System." "What
    is the Reason," said I, "that the Roadway I see rises out of a
    thick Mist at one End, and again loses itself in a thick Mist
    at the other?" "Monopoly and Muddle freely engender Mists,"
    responded the Genius. "Examine now," said he, "the Roadway that
    is bounded with Darkness at both ends, and tell me what thou
    discoverest in it." "I see a Bridge," said I, "standing in the
    midst of the Roadway." "Consider it attentively," said he.</p>

    <p>Upon a more leisurely Survey of it&mdash;a Survey which,
    meseemed, it would have been well had Others made with similar
    Attentiveness&mdash;I found that the Arch thereof looked shaky
    and insecure; moreover, that a Great and Irregular-shaped Cleft
    or Crack ran, after the fashion of a Lightning-flash in a
    Painted Sea-scape, athwart the structure thereof from Keystone
    to Coping. As I was regarding this unpleasing Portent, the
    Genius told me that this Bridge was at first of sound and
    scientific construction, but that the flight of Years, Wear and
    Tear, vehement Molecular Vibration, and, above all, Negligent
    Supervision, had resulted in its present Ruinous Condition.</p>

    <p>"But tell me further," said he, "what thou discoverest on
    it."</p>

    <p>"I see," said I, "if my eyes and the dark Mists and Shadows
    deceive me not, a Figure couched upon the Parapet of the centre
    Arch thereof." As I looked more attentively, I saw that this
    figure was of a Spectral appearance, and Bony withal; albeit,
    its contours were to some extent hidden by its clinging
    cerement-like garments, and the equally clinging and
    charnel-like shades surrounding
    it.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"

    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"
       id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span>

    <p>Only an Attent, and, as it were, complacently Anticipative
    Visage, of an osseous and ogreish Aspect, gleamed lividly forth
    therefrom, as the Apparition appeared to Look and Listen
    through the Mist at one end of the Bridge for the welcome Sight
    of Disaster, the much desired Sound of Doom. A shrill and
    sibilant Metallic Shriek seemed to cleave the Shadows into
    which the Spectre gazed; a Violent Vibratory Pulsation, as of
    thudding iron nails threshing upon a resonant steel floor,
    seemed to heat the Roadway, shake the Bridge, and as it
    appeared to me to widen the levin-like Cleft or Crack which
    disfigured the Arch thereof.</p>

    <p>Then did I quake inwardly and breathe short. "What, O
    Genius," I cried, "signifieth the Spectre, who thus sitteth On
    the Bridge, what forebodeth the Aspect of eager Anticipation,
    and for what doth he so gloatingly and expectantly Wait?"</p>

    <p>"This," responded the Genius, gravely, "is Insatiate Death
    waiting for Inevitable Accident!"</p>

    <p>I gazed with inexpressible melancholy upon the unhappy
    Scene. At length said I, "Show me now, I beseech thee, the
    Secrets that lie hid under those dark Mists which cover the
    regions to the right which you suggest are the realms of
    Monopoly and Muddle." The Genius making me no Answer, I turned
    about to address myself to him a Second time, but I found that
    he had left me. I then turned again to the Vision, but instead
    of the Roadway, the arched Bridge and the Attent Anatomy, I saw
    nothing but my own parlour, and my wife MARY picking up the
    <i>Bradshaw's Guide</i> which had fallen from my sleep-relaxed
    hand.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>On that particular Saint Monday I took, not as I had
    intended, a Railway Excursion to Rural Parts, but, telling
    MARY&mdash;to her manifest concern&mdash;that I Had Altered my
    Mind as regarded our Holiday, I betook myself to the "Blue
    Boar" at the corner, and passed the day in Safety&mdash;and
    Solitary Smoking! Next morning, however, I read something in
    the papers which led me to believe that Railwaydom Aroused
    meant exorcising and evicting that Sinister Spectre,
    "regardless of Cost;" and I shall look forward to my next
    Holiday Outing with a mind Relieved and Reassured.</p>

    Goes nearly to top. What a blessing! Saved all the bother of
    the mount. Go in tennis-shoes, as I'm told there's next to no
    climbing to be done.</p>

    <p>Splendid day for view. Comfortable carriages. Hullo! what's
    this? Find myself suddenly shot into a mountain tarn. A Yankee
    would call it "tarnation cold." Get out dripping. Guard of
    train explains that "battery must be rather too strong this
    morning." Train put on line again. Up we go! Shivery. If I'd
    known this sort of thing went on, I'd have brought towels.</p>

    <p>At Terminus, three-quarters way up, in a bleak and exposed
    crag, plastered with advertisements. Day not quite so glorious.
    Fog coming on. Or is it "Scotch mist?" But what has a Scotch
    mist to do in Wales? Ask engine-driver's opinion. He has none.
    "Then which is the way up?" Doesn't know. "<i>His</i> way is
    down." Must speak to Sir E.W. about engine-driver.</p>

    <p>Ascent continued. Leads down-hill. Curious. Sound of dashing
    waterfall close by. <i>Must</i> see it. Turn round a corner. No
    waterfall at all, only the Electric-Light-generating station!
    Noise I heard was the "machinery in motion."
    <i>Query</i>&mdash;does an iron shed with chimney pouring out
    factory smoke, add to charms of wild scenery?</p>

    <p>More surprises! Find an "Automatic Delivery" pillar! Curious
    sight on a mountain. Put a penny in, and you get a small
    book&mdash;<i>Guide to Snowdonia</i>. Thanks! But what I want
    is a guide to top. Fog worse than ever. Believe I've missed my
    way.</p>

    <p><i>Five hours later</i>.&mdash;I <i>had</i>. Shoes utterly
    worn out. Awfully, tired. Hit on top by mere accident. Resting
    in new hotel. Scrumptious, but dear. Don't care! Electric
    Light. What system? Waiter says "Brush." Must be 'air-brush up
    here, I fancy! Anyhow no good in a fog. Shall suggest foghorn
    to Sir E. WATKIN for thick weather. Also guides waiting at Crag
    Terminus. Bottle of beer. Divine! View? None, and don't want
    any. More beer. Electric Light better than I thought.
    Electricity is life. Electricity is also beer. More beer,
    please! Waiter asks "if I sleep at top?" Beds only two guineas

    <h2>ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h2>

    <p>WATER SUPPLY.&mdash;Yes, we have read about the quantities
    of poisoned fish floating in the river somewhere near the
    "intake" of the Water Companies, and agree with you that under
    such circumstances the pretence of supplying a drinkable fluid
    is somewhat of a "take-in." But surely it is hardly necessary
    to adopt the extreme step you contemplate, of stationing an
    expert Thames fisherman at the side of your cistern night and
    day, in order to catch any fish that may come through the
    pipes. The Companies' filtering system may not be worth much,
    but it ought to be able to keep out something under the size of
    a whale.</p>

    <p>HOLIDAY TRAVELLING.&mdash;You say that recent disclosures
    about Railway Bridges have made you nervous. The plan of
    personally inspecting every bridge your train will pass over on
    your way to Scotland is an excellent one, if you have time for
    it. Possibly also, a Railway Manager might agree to put a
    specially light engine to your train. As you say you are going
    to take a couple of tourist tickets, third class, it would
    probably pay him well to make any little alteration of that
    kind.</p>

    <p>IMPECUNIOSITY.&mdash;We cannot help you. Reading the Riot
    Act and then assaulting them with a poker is not the best way
    of getting the Bailiffs out of a house. Try gentle persuasion.
    If you have recently had a case of black typhus in the house,
    you might mention the fact to them, and see what they say.</p>

    <h3>(A POSSIBLE SCENE OF THE FUTURE.)</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>PLAN OF ACTION.&mdash;<i>Somewhere conveniently situated
        for all parties. The</i> King, <i>the</i> Kaiser, <i>and
        the</i> Emperor, <i>discovered discussing the Treaty that
        has now been in force for some years.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Kaiser</i> (<i>with assumed cheerfulness</i>). Well, my
    dear Brothers, it is really time you should do something. It is
    not on my own account that I am anxious, but on
    yours&mdash;purely on yours.</p>

    <p><i>King</i> (<i>dryly</i>). Certainly!</p>

    <p><i>Emperor</i> (<i>with a smile</i>). No doubt! Pray
    proceed.</p>

    <p><i>Kaiser</i> (<i>addressing Italy</i>). Well, my dear
    friend, as I am afraid we are on the eve of a contest with
    France, I must beg of you to place three Army Corps upon your
    Alpine frontiers.</p>

    <p><i>King</i> (<i>with assumed surprise</i>). Why should I do
    this? It will be most inconvenient!</p>

    <p><i>Kaiser</i>. Why, to carry out the provisions of the
    Treaty.</p>

    <p><i>Emperor</i> (<i>interposing</i>). Your pardon, that
    stipulation was suppressed at King HUMBERT's request.</p>

    <p><i>Kaiser</i> (<i>annoyed</i>). Oh, was it! Then, my friend,
    perhaps you will be so good (as my relations with the CZAR are
    strained almost to breaking), as to station troops on the
    Russian frontier beyond Cracow.</p>

    <p><i>Emperor</i> (<i>with improvised astonishment</i>). Why
    should I do this? It will be most inconvenient.</p>

    <p><i>Kaiser</i>. Why, to carry out the provisions of the
    Treaty.</p>

    <p><i>King</i> (<i>interposing</i>). Your pardon; that
    stipulation was suppressed at the request of the Emperor of
    AUSTRIA.</p>

    <p><i>Kaiser</i>. Oh, was it? (<i>Losing his temper.</i>) Then
    I consider the whole affair as gross a swindle as&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Emperor</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Nay, Sire, remember
    your birth and position! It is a passing annoyance, but it
    should not move you. Remember, you are a Hohenzollern! Let me
    offer you a cigarette.</p>

    <p><i>Kaiser</i> (<i>calming down</i>). Well, perhaps I had
    better be quiet. It is more dignified.</p>

    <p><i>King</i> (<i>helping himself to the Emperor's
    cigarette-case</i>). Let me join you.</p>

    <p><i>Kaiser</i>. But I say, what use is the Treaty to either
    of us?</p>

    <p><i>Emperor</i> (<i>with a smile</i>). Properly treated, it
    is of service to us all. (<i>Lights it, and offers it to his
    two partners</i>). It will serve as a spill for our cigarettes!

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, July 20</i>.&mdash;"Man and boy
    I've sat in this House for seven years," said WHITTAKER ELLIS,
    as he reposed behind Ministers diffusing a sense of aldermanic
    respectability over an appreciable area of space; "never have I
    seen Irish Estimates got through in this style. LORD LIEUTENANT
    has his salary voted without a word of comment, and CHIEF
    SECRETARY will, I believe, get his in a couple of hours. Have
    known the time when it wasn't done in a couple of nights."</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:28%;">
        <a href="images/59-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/59-2.png"
             alt="Mr. Whittaker Ellis." /></a>Aldermanic
             Respectability.
    </div>

    <p>Strange indeed the scene; not thirty Members present whilst
    the Woluminous WEBB goes all the way back to the Tipperary
    riots in search of text for dreary observations; then fearsome
    speeches by FLYNN and P.J. POWER. Some fillip to proceedings
    when JORDAN rolls in.</p>

    <p>JORDAN is Member of Parliament for Clare, as he once or
    twice incidentally remarked. Evidently much impressed by
    distinction. House laughs at reiterated claim. The billows of
    Jordan rise; had no personal objection to Prince ARTHUR, he
    said, but "as Member of Parliament for Clare" had to complain
    of him in his official capacity. What had he done? "He has
    given Clare such a resident Magistrate as CECIL ROCHE, a low
    tyrannical man, who ordered a low policeman to seize
    me&mdash;me, Member of Parliament for Clare."</p>

    <p>JORDAN glared round on laughing House; quite
    incomprehensible what they should be guffawing at. Marvel
    increased when he introduced Father GILLIKAN on the scene,</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:20%;">
        <a href="images/59-3.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/59-3.png"
             alt="Mr. Jordan." /></a>"Member of Parliament for
             Clare."
    </div>

    <p>"What had happened to Father GILLIKAN?" JORDAN roared,
    fixing a bloodshot eye on ASHMEAD-BARTLETT, who had just
    dropped in on Treasury Bench. "Why, Father GILLIKAN had been
    sent to prison for a speech delivered in the middle of the
    River Shannon."</p>

    <p>House shouted with laughter; began again when JORDAN
    explained that Father GILLIKAN, though he had been making a
    speech in the middle of the River Shannon at the moment of his
    arrest, was primarily in a boat. Even that didn't mend matters,
    and JORDAN, giving up attempt to understand ill-timed hilarity
    of House, dried up.</p>

    <p>Later, TIM HEALY turned up, TIM TRUCULENT no more. Where was
    the excited crowd he was wont to address in Sessions of not
    very long ago&mdash;the jeering Ministerialists, the applauding
    Liberals, the enthusiastic band of united Irishmen, with
    PARNELL sitting placid in their midst, he only quiet amid the
    turbulent throng? Now the House more than half empty; the
    audience irresponsive; Prince ARTHUR sitting solitary on
    Treasury Bench with head bowed to hide the blushes that had
    mantled his cheek at hearing TIM extol his improvement since,
    in 1887, he tried his prentice hand as Chief Secretary. Prince
    ARTHUR, when he rises, is careful not to introduce a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"
       id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span> discordant note. He has, he
       says, listened with interest to the able speech of the Hon.
       and learned Gentleman, the Member for North Longford. There
       must be a division for decency's sake; but only 150 Members
       turn up, and no one would have been greatly surprised if
       Prince ARTHUR and TIM HEALY had walked off arm in arm into
       the same lobby.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:28%;">
        <a href="images/60-1.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="Lalor's Lament." /></a>Lalor's Lament.
    </div>

    <p>"Shade of me departed frind, JOSEPH GILLIS," said LALOR,
    wearily rising to go forth to the division, "what d'ye think of
    us, suppose this night you chance to be looking down from
    whatever answers with you to the Strangers' Gallery, where you
    used to betake yourself after being suspended?"</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Irish Votes in Committee of
    Supply.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;The alliance, offensive and defensive,
    established between the two Houses of Legislature by Lord
    DENMAN and Mr. ATKINSON been temporarily blighted by
    machinations of the enemy.</p>

    <p>DENMAN, the other night, wanted to move for return showing
    how many times he had been in attendance. House said it didn't
    particularly care to know. DENMAN insisted; then the MARKISS,
    as usual, appeared on the scene, and moved that DENMAN
    shouldn't be heard for remainder of sitting. DENMAN, never at
    loss in Parliamentary strategy, wanted to move that the
    MARKISS's motion should be put from Chair on that day ten
    months. But LORD CHANCELLOR, well known to be in league with
    the MARKISS, promptly put question. Before DESMAN knew where he
    was (a not unfamiliar access of haziness) Motion put, declared
    to be carried, and he condemned to sit silent for rest of
    evening.</p>

    <p>Same tactics, slightly varied, carried on to effacement of
    other wing of allied forces. ATKINSON wanted to put question to
    JOKIM about his Coinage Bill. Took some pains in framing it;
    handed it in at table; next day question appeared on paper
    shorn of its oratorical excellencies.</p>

    <p>"How is this?" says ATKINSON, addressing the SPEAKER.</p>

    <p>"Question full of errors," SPEAKER explained.</p>

    <p>"Will the Right Hon. Gentleman kindly state them?" said
    ATKINSON, folding his arms, and looking triumphantly round the
    House. Had the SPEAKER now. He would go into particulars. Sure
    to leave opening for master of argumentative tactics; ATKINSON
    would dart in and pink him amid applause of Senate. Public
    business might be delayed, but what of that? House liked
    intellectual treat.</p>

    <p>SPEAKER, however, not so unwary as he looked. Took no notice
    of ATKINSON's inquiry; went on to next business. ATKINSON wrote
    to Clerks for explanation. No reply; so to-day gives notice of
    Vote of Censure on SPEAKER and Clerks.</p>

    <p>"Sorry to be driven to this course, dear TOBY," he said,
    when I ventured to remonstrate with him on his remorseless
    career; "have the greatest respect for the SPEAKER; shrink from
    depriving the Clerks at table of means of livelihood. But an
    example must be made. Effect not confined to walls of this
    Chamber. My Motion of Censure on the SPEAKER will strike terror
    to the House of Lords, and go long way to deliver my noble
    friend DENMAN from thraldom under which a too sensitive nature
    lies bound hand and foot. The House need apprehend no
    inconvenience to the course of public business. Last night, in
    response to a bait artfully thrown out by Mr. TIMOTHY HEALY, I
    felt it my duty to rise in my place and announce that nothing
    would induce me to take office under the Crown. But in the
    matter of the SPEAKER, I shall recognise my personal
    responsibility, and when, in consequence of my Motion of
    Censure, he withdraws into private life, <i>I</i> will take the
    Chair."</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;In Committee of Supply.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Haven't seen SEYMOUR KEAY lately.
    Report in House is, that he has been close and interested
    attendant on CATHCART case. Rumour receives some confirmation
    from circumstance that to-day, CATHCART case concluded, KEAY
    suddenly turns up full of spirits and valuable information.
    Subject (Land Purchase Bill back from Lords) particularly
    attractive to him, since it is bristling with obscurities.
    Once, when a Lords Amendment submitted, TIM HEALY asked what it
    meant. MADDEN sprang up with reassuring alacrity and said a few
    words, apparently of explanation. Didn't clear up anything; TIM
    insisted on wanting to know, you know; MADDEN nervously read
    and reread Amendment, couldn't make head or tale of it, but
    wouldn't do for ATTORNEY-GENERAL for IRELAND to say so.
    Accordingly smiled on TIM with pitying air of superiority.
    "Couldn't understand what the Lords meant by their Amendment?
    Well, well; surprised at such confession from one of TIM's
    acuteness."</p>

    <p>Prince ARTHUR all the while turning over Amendment; at
    length interposed. "The Hon. and learned Gentleman opposite,"
    he observed, "asks for an explanation of this Amendment; I
    frankly tell him I cannot give it. I don't understand it
    myself, and as it would be undesirable to include in the Act a
    provision that might lead to controversy, we will strike it
    out."</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:22%;">
        <a href="images/60-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/60-2.png"
             alt="Mr. Shiress Wills." /></a>"Thus are our Laws
             made!"
    </div>

    <p>"And thus are our laws made!" said SHIRESS WILLS, throwing
    out his hands in astonishment.</p>

    <p>Certainly a narrow escape. It was after this that KEAY's
    patent-leather boots glistened on the floor of House as he
    walked up to take seat below Gangway. Determined to make up for
    lost time; led astray in all directions; SPEAKER called him to
    order with increasing sternness; HENNIKER HEATON asked if he
    might move that for rest of Session he be no longer heard;
    SPEAKER evidently sorely tempted; here was a short sure way out
    of the difficulty. Faltered a moment, then rose heroically to
    sense of duty; put aside proposal, and KEAY went on again for
    another half-hour. "A long rigmarole," JOKIM called the speech.
    This not Parliamentary, but no one objected.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Land Purchase Bill got ready for
    Royal Assent.</p>

    <p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Nothing can exceed MORTON's obliging
    disposition; talked for half an hour just now on subject of
    fortune-telling. Members can't prevent ALPHEUS CLEOPHAS from
    making speeches, but they needn't listen; so kept up lively
    conversation whilst ALPHEUS talked to CLEOPHAS. When he sat
    down, it appeared he had desired that his remarks should reach
    ear of Home Secretary; concluded by asking question; MATTHEWS
    unwarily protested, that, owing to noise in House, he had not
    been able to catch the drift of the Hon. Gentleman's
    remarks.</p>

    <p>"Oh, very well," said ALPHEUS CLEOPHAS, "I'll repeat
    them."</p>

    <p>"No! no!" MATTHEWS almost shrieked.</p>

    <p>"No trouble at all," said ALPHEUS CLEOPHAS, and he set off
    again, making his speech once more. <i>Business
    done.</i>&mdash;Very little.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>FOR THE BENEFIT OF ZOILUS.</h2>

    <p>SHAKSPEARE speaks of "the maiden virtue of the Crown." And
    the word "maiden" bears, in certain constructions, the
    meanings, "fresh, new, youthful, &amp;c." But when <i>Mr.
    Punch</i>, comparing generally "Fifty Years Syne" with To-day,
    says:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Then HER MAJESTY, a Maiden Queen, fresh graced the
            Throne,"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"A SEPTUAGENARIAN" acidly objects, and twits <i>Mr.
    Punch</i> with premature failure of memory. "Aha! I know that
    man!" says <i>Mr. P.</i> <i>Mr. Punch</i>, of course, merely
    meant that about fifty years ago HER MAJESTY was a very
    youthful Sovereign. Moreover, the comparison made between "Then
    and Now" was not intended to be confined rigorously to "July
    17, 1841," as is shown in the previous stanza, which
    says:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Then TOM HOOD could sing that Song which moved a
            world to tears,"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>meaning "<i>The Song of the Shirt</i>," which, as explained
    in a footnote, was not published until 1843. Had <i>Mr.
    Punch</i> written with the fear of ZOILUS before his eyes, he
    might have appended <i>another</i> foot-note, to
    explain&mdash;for the benefit of ZOILUS&mdash;that he did
    <i>not</i> mean to convey the idea that HER MAJESTY was
    unmarried when <i>he</i> first made his appearance. Whereto the
    reply of the Public&mdash;all but ZOILUS&mdash;would probably
    have been, "Whoever supposed you <i>did</i>?"</p>
    <hr />

    <p>"THEN YOU'LL REMEMBER ME!"&mdash;Among the names of those
    who, within the last ten years, have done good work for <i>Mr.
    Punch</i> ought to have appeared that of Mr. SAVILE CLARKE,
    whose <i>cri du coeur</i> from foreign shores has reached
    <i>Mr. P.'s</i> ears and touched <i>Mr. P.'s</i> heart.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>L'ENTENTE CORDIALE.&mdash;A portion of the French Fleet is
    soon to be entertained on English shores. The first of these
    vessels sighted as it approaches will be sufficient evidence of
    their French ship towards us.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>NOTICE.&mdash;Rejected Communications or Contributions,
    whether MS., Printed Matter, Drawings, or Pictures of any
    description, will in no case be returned, not even when
    accompanied by a Stamped and Addressed Envelope, Cover, or
    Wrapper. To this rule there will be no exception.</p>

used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
